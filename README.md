# VocoGroot

This project implements a vocoder using Faust for signal processing and Arduino on the Teensy board for hardware interfacing.

## Files Included:

1. `MyVocoder.ino`: This file contains the Arduino sketch responsible for configuring the audio connections, setting up parameters, and managing input/output for the vocoder.

2. `MyVocoder.h`: Header file defining the `MyVocoder` class, which extends `AudioStream` for audio processing. It also declares necessary includes and definitions.

3. `MyVocoder.cpp`: Implementation file for the `MyVocoder` class, containing the C++ code generated by Faust for sound treatment. This file handles the audio processing logic.

## Usage:

1. Download the Src folder. Open `MyVocoder.ino` in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your Teensy board. Ensure that the three files remain in the same folder, or this won't work.

2. Ensure all necessary connections are made, including audio input/output and any additional controls. The Teensy should have 3 potentiometers and one button connected to it, on pins A0, A1, A2 for the potentiometers and on pin 0 for the button.

3. Make sure you have also connected the Audio shield to the Teensy, and plug in your headset (don't forget the microphone).

4. Run the program and interact with the vocoder using the potentiometers and the button. The potentiometers provide control on volume, frequency and attack+release. The buttons turns the audio processing on or off, so you can hear your modified or real voice when pushing it.

## Dependencies:

- Faust: A programming language specifically designed for real-time signal processing and synthesis.

- Arduino IDE: Integrated development environment for programming Arduino boards.

- Teensyduino: Software add-on for the Arduino IDE that enables programming for Teensy boards.

- Audio Library for Teensy: Library providing high-quality audio processing capabilities for Teensy boards.
